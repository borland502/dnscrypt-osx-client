    %h1 About DNSCrypt-OSXClient
    %p
      This software encrypts and authenticates DNS packets between your computer
      and a DNS resolver using DNSCrypt.

      Tips:
      %ul
        %li
          If you have a firewall, open TCP and UDP ports 53 and 443.
          These are the most common ports used for DNSCrypt.
        %li
          WiFi captive portals dont work if they can't intercept DNS queries
          and often block DNSCrypt.
          So on public WiFi network, disable DNSCrypt, log in, then you can
          enable it again.
        %li
          Using Little Snitch? There are a few rules you need to establish,
          which Little Snitch should prompt for when trying to
          activate this application:
          %ol
            %li Allow any outgoing connection for system processes (dnscrypt-proxy)
            %li Allow any incoming connection for system process (dnscrypt-proxy)
            %li Allow any outgoing connection for system processes (dig)
            %li For automatic updates, allow outgoing TCP connections to port 80 (http) of updates.dnscrypt.org and download.dnscrypt.org, as well as to port 443 (https) of github.com and download.dnscrypt.org for system process (curl)
