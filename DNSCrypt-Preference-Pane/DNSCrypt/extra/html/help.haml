      %h2 Static DNS servers
      %p
        If you are not using DHCP and want a statically configured set
        of default DNS resolvers, enter their IP addresses in this box.
      %p
        Separate them with spaces.
    %section
      %h2 Log DNS queries
      %p
        As a tool designed to protect your privacy, the DNSCrypt proxy does
        not log anything about your DNS queries. Nothing about them will be
        saved to disk ever, and log messages are intentionally kept as generic
        as possible.
      %p
        However, you still may want to look at the DNS queries sent by
        your system. This can be useful in order to spot suspicious
        activity and to refine your domain blacklists and whitelists.
      %p
        Checking the "Log DNS queries" box dumps all DNS queries sent
        by your computer to a file named /var/log/dnscrypt-query.log
      %p
        Blocked queries can also go to a log file. The file is named
        /var/log/dnscrypt-blocked-query.log
      %p
        The "View log" button opens it with the log viewer application
        so that you can watch it in real time. The other button shows
        the blocked queries.

      %h2 IP addresses blocking
      %p
        A response to a query containing at least one IP address
        listed here will be blocked.
      %p
        This make it easy to block spam sources, hosting services and content
        providers using a lot of different domain names for a single service.
      %p
        This can also be useful in order to block DNS rebinding
        attacks, even for non-private network spaces.
      %p
        IP addresses can be IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and must be
        separated with spaces.
    %section
      %h2 Names blocking
      %p
        This is a list of domain names to be blocked.
      %p
        "example.com" will match "example.com" and "www.example.com".
      %p
        But wildcards are also supported. "ads.*" will match any name
        beginning with "ads."
      %p
        Wildcards can also perform substring matching. "*xxx*" will
        match any name containing the string "xxx".
      %p
        Patterns to be blocked should be separated with spaces or new
        lines. Flushing your DNS cache is not required.
      %p
        This feature is only enabled when using DNSCrypt.

      %h2 Exceptions - bypassing DNSCrypt for some specific names
      %p
        Some domain names should not be resolved by a third-party DNS
        resolver, that may not know about them.
      %p
        This includes local domain names provided by home routers
        (like "routerlogin.net"), local domain names provided by
        operating systems and applications (like ".local" or ".lan"),
        local domain names served by appliances like set-top boxes, and
        internal domains used in corporate networks.
      %p
        Domains listed here will bypass DNSCrypt in order to be sent
        to the default resolvers.
      %p
        Do
        %strong not
        use a tool like hostip(8), drill(1), unbound-host(1), dig(1) or host(1)
        in order to check that an exception rule works.
      %p
        These tools use their own resolution mechanisms that have nothing
        to do with how others apps on your system are resolving names.
      %p
        They don't use the OSX-specific stub resolver, they don't use
        the system-wide DNS cache, they have bugs and limitations that the OS
        doesn't have (and the opposite is also true), and they don't know a
        thing about specific resolvers that have to be used for specific
        domains.
      %p
        Use actual apps, or even a command such as ping(8).
